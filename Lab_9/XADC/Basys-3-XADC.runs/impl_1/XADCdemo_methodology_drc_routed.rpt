SYNTH-13#1 Warning
combinational multiplier  
Detected combinational multiplier in DSP instance m_b2d/data1.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -16.083 ns between b2d_din_reg[3]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and m_b2d/data_reg[10]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
